"""Keep an update alive when an enabled plugin no longer fits the new core.

Admission refuses a plugin that does not fit, because the user is choosing and can
choose again. An update has nobody to ask and must never fail because of a plugin:
core moved (a newer Python, a bumped pin, a newer manifest contract) under a plugin
that was admitted against the old core. Such a plugin is disabled in every home that
enables it, the reason reaches the operator and the receipt, and the update continues
with the rest. Only a core that cannot build on its own still fails.

Disabling needs evidence about the plugin itself: its requires-python against the pinned
interpreter, its manifest contract, a resolver proof, or its build failing. A fetch or
tooling failure could be the moment, so the plugin gets one retry before it is disabled.
requires_hermes is judged against a version identity that can lag (a checkout without its
release tags), so a misfit there only sits out: config is untouched, boot skips it the same
way, and it rejoins when the verdict flips. A secondary profile whose config cannot be read
sits out until its config is fixed.
